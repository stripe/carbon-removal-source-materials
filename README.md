# Stripe Climate Carbon Removal Purchases - Source Materials

> Appendix to https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/spring-21-carbon-removal-purchases.

These materials form the basis of our carbon removal purchases. We're releasing them to the public, under a CC-0 "Public Domain" license, to promote transparency and knowledge-sharing in the field. 

In the [`Project Applications`](./Project%20Applications) directory, you'll find the **raw PDF file of each project's application**. We are grateful to the projects for participating in this process, and agreeing to have their applications made public.

In the root of the repo, you'll find:

- Our [project applications](./Project%20Applications/Spring%202021) from our latest Spring 2021 cycle as well as archived material from 2020.
- Our new [template project application](./\[Template\]%20Project%20Application/Srping%202021), including modular supplements for Direct Air Capture, Surface Mineralization, Biomass, Oceans, Geologic Injection, and CO2 Utilization. As with the other materials, these are available in the public domain: please use them!
- The [template review forms](./\[Template\]%20Review%20Forms/Spring%2021.pdf) that our science and governance reviewers used to provide feedback.
- Our [purchase agreements](./Purchase%20Agreements/Spring%2021) we used to make our purchases. These are the literal contracts, including funding terms for purchase and R&D, technical milestones, renewal criteria, and more.
