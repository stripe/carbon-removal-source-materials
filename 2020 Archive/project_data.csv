,,,,Not neccessarily the same as total project volume probably due to different interpretations of the question,,,Value for GreenSand was subtracted from 1 because they appeared to compute the ratio backwards.,"For Carbon Sequestration Inc and Bluesource, the year reported is the timeframe of likely permanence but project additionally assumes some risk of loss, this is ignored in the reported number",,,
